This project started as my end of year assignment at college and grew into my first attempt at writing a functional application. I'm putting it up here only for prosperity and future opportunities for nostalgia.

I can't even count the number of awful design decisions which have been made in the construction, but I'm also surprised at how cohesive it is for a first run at programming something.

It isn't expected to be functional or useful in any manner, but I hope some smiles come from reading it.
